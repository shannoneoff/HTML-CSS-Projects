		<!-- First step in hiring a contractor -->
		<h1 id="HiringContractor Section">Hiring A Contractor</h1>
			<p>In order to transform my ordinary master bedroom and bathroom into a master suite vacation rental in Newberg, the first step was to meet with contractors on-site and ask them to bid work I would like to have done.  My partner and I gave them ideas for the materials we prefer.  Mostly, I just need aesthetic updates, so the bidding process is not overly complicated.  The only major decision to make is whether to bump out a closet to create a large shower area or to keep the current 4'x4' fiberglass shower in place.</p>

			<p>Modernization of this particular typical '90s-era, single-level home is imperative.  We plan on bringing in the engineered acacia wood floors from the living room and hallway to the master bedroom for cohesion and tile in the bathroom to match the large rectangular tiles of the hall bathroom and hallway laundry closet.  The bedroom walls and trim will be repainted to match the current dark blue and white, while the bathroom walls will be updated with white shiplap paneling using a horizontal pattern to make the small bathroom feel more spacious.</p>
		
		<!-- The entrance is important -->
		<h2 id="Entrance Section">Entrance</h2>
			<p>One of the most <em>important</em> elements in a vacation rental is the entrance.  To make guests feel like they are entering a special space, we will replace the current, basic wood gate with a wood and metal gate and create a pathway using rock and non-uniform-looking pavers (a very customized look).  We will also be fencing off the patio attached to the master suite and part of the yard so that guests feel free to bring their dogs.

		<!-- Hope to have it started by... -->
		<h2 id="StartingDate Section">Starting Date</h2>
			<p>I hope to have this vacation rental up and running for guests to begin booking their stays on or before <time datetime="2022-10-31 00:01">October 31, 2022</time>.  Due to contractor scheduling and supply shortages, that time will need to be met with much flexibility.</p>

		<!-- My Experience -->
		<details>
			<summary><b><u>My Professional Management Experience</u></b></summary>
			<p><font size=2px>Shannon worked in long-term (mainly residential) property management for 12 years prior to purchasing her own property management company, which she owned for another 8 years and sold in 2021.  Long-term management and vacation/short-term management are different in some aspects, such as the much quicker pace of turnover with short-term.  However, the experience dealing with renters has parallels as well as handling maintenance, budgeting, and economic forecasting.</font></p>
