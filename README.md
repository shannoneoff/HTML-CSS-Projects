# HTML-CSS-Projects
HTML- and CSS-based projects created during my time at The Tech Academy
## **Website**
### **_Specs of What's Included:_**

- [Main webpage](Assignment.html)
- [Page with photo](Dog.html)
- [Page with embedded YouTube video + Link to video](Dog_Video.html)
- Navigation bars on each page

The idea of this website is to show the function and design of a basic webpage created with HTML.  The [main webpage](Assignment.html) shows a resized photo with caption, headings of different sizes, paragraphs of text with specific width, links to a different webpage and website, footer, and navigation bar.

A [second webpage](Dog.html) contains a photo linked from the main page along with navigation bar.

Lastly, a [third webpage](Dog_Video.html) contains an embedded YouTube video and link to the same video along with the navigation bar as shown on the other two pages of the site.

The content and photo on the main page are my own and involves a story of a home remodeling project I have taken on.

Everything about this site is fairly basic and is a jumping off point for what I hope to do in the future with my coding studies and subsequent employment as a technology professional.
